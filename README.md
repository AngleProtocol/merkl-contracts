This repository contains the smart contracts of the Merkl product developed by Angle.

It basically contains two contracts:

- `DistributionCreator`: to which DAOs and individuals can deposit their rewards to incentivize a pool
- `Distributor`: the contract where users can claim their rewards

You can learn more about the Merkl system in the [documentation](https://docs.merkl.xyz/).
