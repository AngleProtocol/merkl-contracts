[![CI](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/merkl-contracts/workflows/Merkl%20Contracts%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/merkl-contracts/actions)

This repository contains the smart contracts of the Merkl product developed by Angle.

It basically contains two contracts:

- `DistributionCreator`: to which DAOs and individuals can deposit their rewards to incentivize a pool
- `Distributor`: the contract where users can claim their rewards

You can learn more about the Merkl system in the [documentation](https://docs.angle.money/side-products/merkl).

## Setup

### Install packages

You can install all dependencies by running

```bash
yarn
forge i
```

### Create `.env` file

In order to interact with non local networks, you must create an `.env` that has, for all supported networks (Ethereum, Polygon and Arbitrum):

- `MNEMONIC`
- `ETH_NODE_URI`
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`

You can copy paste the `.env.example` file into `.env` and fill with your keys/RPCs.

Warning: always keep your confidential information safe.

### Tests

Contracts in this repo rely on Hardhat tests. You can run tests as follows:
